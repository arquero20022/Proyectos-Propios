Details: 
Four fairytale themed sprites: Adult and child Little Red Riding Hood, Cheshire cat and the Queen of Hearts.
(Adult) Little Red Riding Hood sprite goes together with Archeia's portrait from Restaff February 2014. 
The sprites are edited from the VX(Ace) RTP.

Notes: 
To be able to use the sprites in VX(Ace), please do not remove the $ from the file name.
Thank you Archeia for providing an amazing portrait :)
I have previously made an Alice sprite as well as a Dinah sprite. You can find it in Restaff March-June 2014 or in my thread: http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/25123-slims-vxa-sprites-and-icons/
