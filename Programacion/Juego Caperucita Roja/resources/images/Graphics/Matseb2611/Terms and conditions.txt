Notes:

If you're unsure on how to use any of the above, feel free to send me a message and 
I'll be happy to help.

To use the battle transitions, simply copy one of them, paste into your project's folder,
and finally rename it to 'BattleStart'.

Parasitic Alien sprite acts as a stationary decoration, rather than a mobile character,
so each row is different.

Ancient Greek decorations act as one of the B-E tilesheets.
